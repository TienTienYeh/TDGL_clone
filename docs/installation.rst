``pyTDGL`` requires ``Python 3.9``.

We recommend creating a new
`conda environment <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
for ``pyTDGL`` to avoid dependency conflicts with other packages. To create a new conda environment called
``tdgl``, run ``conda create --name tdgl python=3.9``.
After the environment has been created, run ``conda activate tdgl`` to activate it.
